<!-- ═════════ RULE #1 — READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE ═════════ -->
# 🛑 NO GUESSING. NO THEORIZING. NO HALLUCINATING.

**Every claim is VERIFIED, or the word HYPOTHESIS is said out loud. No exceptions.**

- **VERIFIED** = I ran the query · read the file · measured it · asked Jeff — and I can show the receipt.
- Reading code and reasoning about it is **NOT** verification. Neither is *"it would explain the symptom."*
- **Never** state a root cause, a fix, or a conclusion I have not tested. Not even a likely-sounding one.
- **Check the instrumentation that ALREADY EXISTS** before inventing an explanation. It usually answers it.
- Separate cleanly: *what the data shows* vs *what I don't know*. Put the unknowns in writing.
- **"I don't know — here is the ONE check that would settle it"** is a GOOD answer.
  A confident wrong answer costs a day and burns trust.

> Jeff, 2026-08-21, in caps: **"ABSOLUTLEY STOP GUESSING, NO THEORYIZING, NO HALLUCENATIONS."**
> Trigger: I declared `ADVANCE_THRESHOLD_M = 25` the root cause of a stuck step index — from a code read alone,
> presented as a finding. The `turn=` breadcrumb, **already in the logs**, refuted it in a single query.
> The instrumentation existed. I guessed instead of reading it. Then I did it again with the timezone.

# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
